# Welcome to my profile! 👋🏽

## Brief

Hello there, I'm **Anthony I. Jackson**, a 16 years old **Game and Software Developer** with around ~4 years of experience *(as a hobby.)*

## What do I do?

I currently do have a job, working at the Coded By Kids organization but after the summer ends I'll be out of a job. Quite unfortunate.

For hobbies I spent most of my time programming since it is my favorite thing to do.

If you count game development as a hobby thats one of the things I do on my spare time but along with that I also take time creating music in Music Trackers for retro computers and video game consoles.

**Hobbies:**

* Game/Software Development
* Music Composition/Arranging

## What about your future?

* For the most part I haven't really thought that far about my future as I think of it as something that future me will have to worry about and to be honest I'm trying to have fun while I can before paying taxes and bills becomes the thing I do for the rest of my life.

If you want a general idea, you would probably imagine my career choice being in IT.

Most likely in Web Development or continued Software Development since I'm a very big of *low-level computing*.

## What happening now?

I'm currently a student in my senior year of High School *(Secondary School)*. **Class of 2024!** 😁🎉
